# üß† Countdown & üêç Snake ‚Äì Java Team Projects

This repository contains two Java-based projects developed in a team of three students during the second semester
of the Software Engineering program at Hochschule Heilbronn (Module: *Komplexe Programme*).  
We collaborated using GitLab, with a strong focus on version control workflows, code quality, and structured teamwork.

## [üìÅ Projects](app/src/main/java/livesession) + [JUnit](app/src/test/java/livesession)

### [üß† Countdown (Console Application)](app/src/main/java/livesession/countdown)

A terminal-based application inspired by the British game show *Countdown*.  
The program calculates all possible arithmetic expressions from a set of five numbers to reach a given target number using basic operations (+, ‚àí, √ó, √∑).

- **Key Challenges:** Designing and implementing an efficient algorithm to explore the solution space
- **Technologies Used:** Java, JUnit
- **Skills Applied:** Algorithm development, pseudocode design, test-driven development
- **Theory Applied:** Algorithms & Data Structures (thought in Semester 3) and parts of the [YouTube playlist by

### [üêç Snake (JavaFX Game)](app/src/main/java/livesession/snake)

A real-time Snake game with a responsive JavaFX user interface.  
The project architecture follows the **MVVM** pattern and includes multithreaded game logic and dynamic user interaction.

- **Features:**
    - Live game loop (pause/resume using `wait()`/`notify()`)
    - Observable properties for score, game state and board
    - GUI elements (SnakeBoard, SnakeCell, SnakeDisplay)
    - Keyboard and button controls for navigation and game actions

- **Technologies Used:** Java, JavaFX, JUnit, Git, Multithreading
- **Skills Applied:** GUI development, MVVM architecture, observable state binding, concurrent programming

## üë• Team Collaboration & Git Workflow

Both projects were implemented in a team of three using GitLab.  
We practiced Git-based collaboration with separate feature branches, merge requests, and conflict resolution.  
We studied Git fundamentals through [learngitbranching.js.org](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=de_DE) as part of our self-guided learning.

# üêç Snake ‚Äì Original Project Notes

## Getting Started

```
# Suggested Git setup:
cd existing_repo
git remote add origin https://git.it.hs-heilbronn.de/it/courses/seb/kprog/kprog-2023-ws.git
git branch -M main
git push -uf origin main
```

## Essential Git Commands

```
git status                  # Show status of current branch
git pull                    # Sync local branch with remote
git add ./foldername
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"
git push                    # Always push to your own branch first
git merge branchname        # Merge the selected branch into the current one
```

## Useful Terminal Commands

```
cd foldername         # Navigate into a folder
ls                    # List folder contents
mkdir newFolder       # Create a new folder
rm filename           # Delete a file
```

## Project Introduction

Welcome to our Snake game project developed for the Komplexe Programme module.
We chose a *single-screen* design to keep the implementation focused and efficient. Below are our reasons:

## Design Choices

**Functionality First**: A minimal UI allowed us to concentrate on implementing core gameplay features.

**Time & Resource Efficiency**: Focused development within the project timeframe.

**User-Friendly**: One screen simplifies player interaction and enhances usability.

**Risk Minimization**: A simpler structure reduces potential bugs and improves maintainability.

## Mockup Implementation

While the original plan included multiple screens, we decided a single, state-driven interface was more effective.
UI elements are enabled or disabled depending on the game state, providing clear configuration and gameplay within one unified interface.

## Conclusion

This version of Snake lays a solid foundation for future expansion ‚Äì including visual improvements, added features, and enhanced gameplay.
