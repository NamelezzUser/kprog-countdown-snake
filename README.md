## Project Introduction

Welcome to our Snake game project developed for the Komplexe Programme module.
We chose a *single-screen* design to keep the implementation focused and efficient. Below are our reasons:

## Design Choices

**Functionality First**: A minimal UI allowed us to concentrate on implementing core gameplay features.

**Time & Resource Efficiency**: Focused development within the project timeframe.

**User-Friendly**: One screen simplifies player interaction and enhances usability.

**Risk Minimization**: A simpler structure reduces potential bugs and improves maintainability.

## Mockup Implementation

While the original plan included multiple screens, we decided a single, state-driven interface was more effective.
UI elements are enabled or disabled depending on the game state, providing clear configuration and gameplay within one unified interface.

## Conclusion

This version of Snake lays a solid foundation for future expansion ‚Äì including visual improvements, added features, and enhanced gameplay.
